# RX-8 Telemetry Android

Android app in development for viewing live vehicle data and recording trips without an Internet connection.

**Current implementation: an Android simulator foundation. Real Bluetooth/OBD acquisition, saved trips, and API integration are not implemented yet.**

The simulator uses deterministic synthetic readings and supports normal operation, timeouts, and missing data.
Connect, disconnect, and reset controls make demonstrations repeatable.
Sampling runs only while the app is in the foreground; this foundation does not record in the background.

Installation on the Samsung A53 and physical compatibility with the car remain unverified.
There are no published APK releases or deployed APIs.

## Reference vehicle and equipment

- 2004 Mazda RX-8, 231 metric horsepower (CV), European market.
- Samsung Galaxy A53; Android version still to be checked.
- iLC OBD2 Bluetooth adapter, ASIN B0BDRHRR22. [Selected product](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B0BDRHRR22).
- Classic Bluetooth and ELM327-compatible commands are the initial assumptions; both must be checked with the actual adapter.

The goal is to display **all available and verified data** from this vehicle. OBD2 does not guarantee access to every module or sensor.
A working simulator does not prove that the adapter or car supports any particular parameter.

## Planned MVP

- Connect the adapter and discover the supported protocol and parameters.
- Live dashboard with units and the status of each reading.
- Vehicle profile with a permanent ID and an optional vehicle identification number (VIN).
- Manual trip start and stop, local storage, history, charts, and export.
- Recording with the screen locked, managed as an explicit session.
- Data models and a queue for a future API, with uploads disabled.

These features describe the target MVP, not the capabilities of the current simulator.
Fault diagnostics, Mazda-specific sensors, GPS/maps, and a server are deferred to later phases.
The first version does not include actuator control, ECU reprogramming, or clearing fault codes.

## Getting started

Open the repository in Android Studio with JDK 17 or 21 and Android SDK Platform 36.
The project contains the Android `:app` module and the pure Kotlin `:core:telemetry` module.

See [Development](docs/development.md) for pinned tool versions, SDK setup, simulator behavior, build commands, and pending device checks.
Build and test results belong in the relevant PR; setup instructions alone are not evidence that checks passed.

- [Milestones](https://github.com/gonibix23/rx8-telemetry-android/milestones)
- [New issue](https://github.com/gonibix23/rx8-telemetry-android/issues/new/choose)
- [Pull requests](https://github.com/gonibix23/rx8-telemetry-android/pulls)

Each issue has a scope and acceptance criteria. Implementation changes go through a PR linked to an issue.
[RX8-002](https://github.com/gonibix23/rx8-telemetry-android/issues/2) remains open until its Samsung A53 installation check is completed.
[RX8-001](https://github.com/gonibix23/rx8-telemetry-android/issues/1) tracks separate validation with the real car and adapter.

## Documentation checks

Documentation checks require Node.js 22 or later and npm.

```sh
npm ci
npm run lint:docs
```

These commands check Markdown. Android build, unit-test, and lint commands are listed in [Development](docs/development.md).
